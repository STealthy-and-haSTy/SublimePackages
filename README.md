SublimePackages
================

This repository contains the channel file that presents all of the officially
released packages from the `STealthy and haSTy` GitHub organization to the
default [Package Control Channel](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel)
as well as providing an alternate channel for packages currently under
development.

The [packages.json](packages.json) file is directly included by Package
Control, which makes all packages defined within it directly available to
every Package Control user.

The [unreleased-packages.json](unreleased-packages.json) file is an additional
file which contains all packages currently under development that have not been
officially released yet.

In order to access the packages listed there, select the `Package Control: Add
Repository` command from the command palette and paste in the URL
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/SublimePackages/master/unreleased-packages.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/SublimePackages/master/unreleased-packages.json).
